    notes: `A <b>two-stroke engine</b> is an <b>internal combustion engine</b> that completes a <b>power cycle</b> in two piston strokes (<b>one crankshaft revolution</b>). The piston moves from <b>top dead center</b> (TDC) to <b>bottom dead center</b> (BDC) and back generating one power stroke per revolution.<br>

    title: "Four Stroke IC Engine",
    notes: `A <b>four-stroke engine</b> is an <b>internal combustion engine</b> that completes a <b>power cycle</b> in four steps: <b>intake</b>, <b>compression</b>, <b>power</b>, and <b>exhaust</b>. These steps occur over two revolutions of the <b>crankshaft</b>, making the engine more <b>fuel-efficient</b> and producing lower <b>emissions</b> compared to other types.<br>

},

'1.8': {
    title: "Four Stroke IC Engine Working",
    notes: `The working of a <b>four-stroke engine</b> involves four main steps:<br>
<b>Intake:</b> The engine draws in a mixture of air and fuel as the piston moves down in the cylinder (<b>TDC</b> to <b>BDC</b>)<br>
<b>Compression:</b> The piston moves back up (<b>BDC</b> to <b>TDC</b>) compressing the air-fuel mixture which increases its <b>pressure</b> and <b>temperature</b>.<br>
<b>Power:</b> At the top of the stroke, the <b>spark plug</b> ignites the compressed mixture causing a small explosion that pushes the piston down (<b>TDC</b> to <b>BDC</b>), creating power.<br>
<b>Exhaust:</b> Finally, the piston moves back up again (<b>BDC</b> to <b>TDC</b>) expelling the burnt gases from the cylinder through the <b>exhaust valve</b>.<br>
This sequence repeats for each cycle allowing the engine to produce continuous power.<br>
Each cycle gives <b>720 degrees</b> of <b>crankshaft rotation</b>.<br>

},

'1.10': {
    title: "Requirement of clutch",
    notes: `It should transmit <b>125 to 150%</b> at all times.<br>
Heat generated because of <b>friction</b> should be dissipated quickly.<br>
<b>Vibration</b> because of friction must be low.<br>
It should be <b>easy to operate</b>.<br>

    title: "Friction Clutch",
    notes: `When shaft <b>A</b> and disc <b>C</b> are spinning at a certain speed (<b>N rpm</b>) and shaft <b>B</b> with disc <b>D</b> is stationary, the clutch is not engaged. To engage the clutch, an <b>axial force (W)</b> is applied to disc <b>D</b>, bringing it into contact with disc <b>C</b>. Once they touch, <b>friction</b> between the two discs causes <b>D</b> to start rotating. The speed of <b>D</b> depends on the friction, which increases as the applied force <b>W</b> increases. Gradually increasing <b>W</b> will cause <b>D</b> to spin faster and eventually <b>D</b> will reach the same speed as <b>C</b>, at which point the clutch is fully engaged.<br>

},

'1.12': {
    title: "Cone Clutch",
    notes: `The diagram shows a basic <b>cone clutch</b>. In this type, the contact surfaces are shaped like <b>cones</b>. When the clutch is disengaged, the <b>male cone</b> fits fully inside the <b>female cone</b> so the friction surfaces are in full contact. <b>Springs</b> keep the male cone pressed inside. When the clutch is engaged, <b>torque</b> is transferred from the <b>engine</b> through the <b>flywheel</b> and male cone to the <b>gearbox shaft</b>. To disengage the clutch, the male cone is pulled out using a <b>lever system</b> connected to the <b>clutch pedal</b>, which separates the contact surfaces.<br>

'1.13': {
    title: "Single Plate Clutch",
    notes: `A <b>single-plate clutch</b> is used in most light vehicles to connect the <b>engine</b> to the <b>transmission</b>. It has only one <b>clutch plate</b>.<br>
The clutch plate is a thin metal disc with <b>friction material</b> on both sides. The <b>flywheel</b> is attached to the engine and spins with it. The <b>pressure plate</b> is held against the clutch by <b>springs</b>, keeping the clutch disengaged.<br>
When you press the <b>clutch pedal</b>, the springs compress and the pressure plate moves back, freeing the clutch plate from the flywheel. This disengages the engine from the transmission, allowing you to <b>change gears</b>. While the pedal is pressed, the clutch stays disengaged and the vehicle can change gears without moving.<br>

    title: "Transmission System",
    notes: `The <b>transmission system</b> in a vehicle includes several key parts: the <b>clutch</b>, <b>gearbox</b> (or transmission), <b>propeller shaft</b>, and <b>differential gear</b>. The clutch connects and disconnects the engine from the gearbox. The gearbox provides <b>four</b>, <b>five</b>, or even <b>six</b> different <b>gear ratios</b> to control <b>torque</b>. The propeller shaft carries the torque from the gearbox to the <b>rear axle</b>. Finally, the differential gear splits the torque evenly between the two driving wheels for smooth operation.<br>

    notes: `In a general <b>automobile layout</b>, the <b>engine</b> is the starting point generating power. The <b>clutch</b> follows, allowing smooth engagement and disengagement of the engine's power to the <b>gearbox</b>. The gearbox provides various <b>gear ratios</b> to control <b>speed</b> and <b>torque</b>. The <b>chassis</b> supports the vehicle's components. The <b>propeller shaft</b> transmits torque from the gearbox to the <b>differential</b>, which splits the torque to the <b>wheels</b>. The wheels move the vehicle while the <b>radiator</b> near the engine cools the engine by dissipating heat from the <b>coolant</b>.<br>

    title: "Constant Mesh Gearbox",
    notes: `In a <b>constant mesh gearbox</b>, all gears are always engaged with gears on the <b>layshaft</b>. The <b>main shaft</b> has gears that can rotate freely, but <b>dog clutches</b> are used to engage or disengage specific gears. By sliding the dog clutches using the <b>selector mechanism</b>, different gears are selected. Sliding the left dog clutch left engages the <b>direct gear</b>, and sliding it right engages the <b>second gear</b>. Moving the right dog clutch left selects the <b>low gear</b>, while sliding it right engages <b>reverse gear</b>.<br>

    title: "Synchromesh Gearbox",
    notes: `A <b>synchromesh gearbox</b> is similar to a <b>constant mesh gearbox</b> where all gears on the <b>main shaft</b> are always in mesh with the <b>layshaft gears</b>. The main difference is the addition of a <b>synchromesh device</b> that allows smoother gear engagement by matching the speeds of the gears before they connect. This removes the need for <b>double declutching</b>. When shifting gears, the parts come into frictional contact first to equalize their speed, allowing them to engage smoothly without causing <b>grinding</b> or <b>harshness</b> during gear changes.<br>

'1.19': {
    title: "Rack and Pinion Steering System",
    notes: `The <b>rack and pinion steering gear</b> converts the <b>rotary motion</b> of the <b>steering wheel</b> into <b>linear motion</b>. The steering wheel's motion is transmitted to the <b>pinion</b> which meshes with a <b>rack</b>. This turns the circular motion of the pinion into linear movement of the rack which is then passed through <b>ball joints</b> and <b>tie rods</b> to the <b>stub axles</b>, steering the <b>wheels</b>. The <b>center take-off design</b> allows for high mounting, saving space and reducing length.<br>

    notes: `The <b>reciprocating ball-type steering gear</b> features a <b>worm</b> at the end of the <b>steering rod</b> with a <b>nut</b> mounted on the worm.<br><br>
Two sets of <b>balls</b> in grooves reduce <b>friction</b> as the nut moves along the worm.<br><br>
The nut has <b>teeth</b> that mesh with a <b>sector gear</b> connected to a <b>drop arm</b> that steers the <b>road wheels</b> via <b>link rods</b> and <b>steering arms</b>.<br><br>

    title: "Leaf Spring",
    notes: `<b>Semi-elliptic leaf springs</b> are widely used for <b>suspension</b> in light and heavy <b>commercial vehicles</b>, providing effective <b>support</b> and <b>shock absorption</b>. They work by flexing under load, distributing weight evenly and allowing for smooth vehicle movement. While commonly found in the rear suspension of cars, <b>coil springs</b> have largely replaced them in modern <b>passenger vehicles</b> due to their lighter weight and better <b>handling characteristics</b>.<br>

'1.22': {
    title: "Helper Leaf Springs",
    notes: `<b>Helper springs</b> are added to many <b>commercial vehicles</b> alongside the main <b>leaf springs</b> to support a wider range of <b>loading conditions</b>. When the vehicle is lightly loaded, the helper springs remain inactive. As the load increases, these springs engage and share the load to enhance <b>support</b> and <b>stability</b>.
